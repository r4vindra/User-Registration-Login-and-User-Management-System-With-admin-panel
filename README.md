# Vulnerability Reports


This repository contains formatted vulnerability reports and PoCs (Proofs of Concept) intended for tracking, sharing internally, or publishing (with permission). Each vulnerability is stored in `vulnerabilities/` as its own markdown file. PoCs and test artifacts live under `poc/`.


> **Important:** Only test PoCs against systems you are authorized to test. Unauthorized scanning, exploitation, or disclosure is illegal and unethical.
